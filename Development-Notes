Development notes
Trying to get in the habit of verbose note taking

Goal: Make the life regen on right side include number of actual replenishment like 1% + 24 (the actual number)
In functions.js: 
Change lifetotal variable to global so it can be read by other funtions
Change life_regen formula to include lifetotal and output accurate number (this is mainly informative if using prayer aura)

Goal: add minus eneby phy resists on right with the other minus resists
Index.html: add line for enemy_physRes below enemy_mres
functions: add line for enemy_physRes below enemy_mres
barbarian.js: add effect:5 to the skills_barbarian definition of grim ward to allow it to be counted in enemy_physRes

Goal: add phys facet type damage where other facet damages show on left
Index: add line for physicalDamage below mdamage
functions: add line for physicalDamage below mdamage

Fix evade buff from hustle not showing on right
Add evade to zon buffdata section of universal_skills
Add evade 0skill entries in BOTH places of basic_variables

Goal: show aura tick damage for non-paladin classes (pally's can just hover over the skill to see it, others can't do that)
Items.js: add min/max properties for tick damage
item_metadata: add min/max properties, display format for tick damage
functions: alter aura entries (holy freeze/fire/shock and sanctuary) in getAuradata function to include the newly created min & max tick damage propeties. Need to account for sorc masteries, paladin synergies, and facet-type boosts.

Also added righteous flame damage back in, not sure when it was commented out in index
