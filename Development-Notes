Goal: Make the life regen on right side include number of actual replenishment like 1% + 24 (the actual number)
In functions.js: 
Change lifetotal variable to global so it can be read by other funtions
Change life_regen formula to include lifetotal and output accurate number (this is mainly informative if using prayer aura)
